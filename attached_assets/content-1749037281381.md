# Dark theme

A dark theme is a low-light UI that displays mostly dark surfaces.

![App screen transitioning from a light to a dark theme.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2dBw3e0xPpK37MzJ9pci2OySJiHhQCNY1RIHAYkJ5PBbBzApRNkbOgV0RCzsJw0VOOiiBxyoIc_QhbRxGiTw-DgHVc1-_NWaFJ0C=w1064-v0)

A light and dark theme UI

## Usage

A dark theme displays dark surfaces across the majority of a UI. It's designed to be a supplemental mode to a default (or light) theme.

Dark themes reduce the luminance emitted by device screens, while still meeting minimum color contrast ratios. They help improve visual ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions, and facilitating screen use in dark environments – all while conserving battery power. Devices with OLED screens benefit from the ability to turn off black pixels at any time of day.

### Principles

Use dark grey – rather than black – to express elevation and space in an environment with a wider range of depth. Apply limited color...

#### Color with accents

Apply limited color accents in dark theme UIs, so the majority of space is dedicated to dark surfaces.

Material Design dark themes are defined by the following properties:

- **Contrast:** Dark surfaces and 100% white body text have a contrast level of at least 15.8:1
- **Depth:** At higher levels of elevation, components express depth by displaying lighter surface colors
- **Desaturation:** Primary colors are desaturated so they pass the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG) AA standard of at least 4.5:1 (when used with body text) at all elevation levels
- **Limited color:** Large surfaces use a dark surface color, with limited color accents (light, desaturated and bright, saturated colors)

## Properties

A dark theme uses dark grey, rather than black, as the primary surface color for components. Dark grey surfaces can express a wider range of color, elevation, and depth, because it's easier to see shadows on grey (instead of black).

Dark grey surfaces also reduce eye strain, as light text on a dark grey surface has less contrast than light text on a black surface.

![A swatch of the color #121212.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wWTcU93BwGcU0B_pVHAUkMFj6jlM0CLPjJdax-Lv-sLo2uslQrrPSaxTEcUpGJVEA0m665bRfFgwTQX9OxQKbwqVtpinA72j4ceFcQ=w1064-v0)

The recommended dark theme surface color is #121212.

### Elevation

Read more

In a dark theme, components retain the same default elevation levels and shadows as components in lighter themes. However, in a dark theme, the surfaces of different elevation levels are illuminated differently.

#### Higher elevation, lighter surface

The higher a surface's elevation (raising it closer to an implied light source), the lighter that surface becomes. That lightness is expressed through the application of a semi-transparent [overlay](https://material.io/design/interaction/states.html#anatomy "") using the [On Surface](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#ui-application "") color.

_volume\_off__volume\_off_

Unmute

As a surface raises in elevation, it becomes lighter in color.

A dark theme surface is constructed by placing a semi-transparent overlay over a component surface.

![Anatomy diagram of two surfaces stacked with two callouts.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QdsRbbmvyqvIxojK4GehdCTrzkWaIBTvTRL1fufWGNz0J1T63V-4dV22YYSHXRPFkDX5zl6hV4pgCFxPJvTPusBaXMYTR-60ER8rNw=w1064-v0)

A surface becomes lighter with the application of a semi-transparent white overlay.

1\. Surface

2\. Elevation overlay

An overlay on a surface also makes it easier to distinguish elevation between components and to see shadows. Overlays add contrast between surfaces and their shadows, making the edges of each surface more apparent.

_volume\_off__volume\_off_

Mute

Unmute

Default themes use shadows to express elevation, while a dark theme also expresses elevation by adjusting the surface color.

These surface overlay values are designed to maximize legibility, while ensuring the different elevation levels are discernible from one another.

![Ten elevation surfaces ranging from the lowest level to highest level.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MZFRD7NVPpsDPgaWSxLb_9rapm7FFMh2kp6nJuAUrIORQadQtlG5BQ5flovINSBW1fCohcC-mZsFQDpSNKPMEEv08at_zHVKHWiU=w1064-v0)

Elevation overlay transparencies range from 0% for the lowest level to 16% for the highest level.

| Elevation level | White overlay <br>transparency |
| --- | --- |
| 00dp | 0% |
| 01dp | 5% |
| 02dp | 7% |
| 03dp | 8% |

| 06dp | 11% |
| 08dp | 12% |
| 12dp | 14% |
| 16dp | 15% |
| 24dp | 16% |

Overlays clarify the elevation difference between components.

![Anatomy diagram of components in context with different elevation surfaces with three call outs.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A-Q9l0J1FzDR62df2r-JoriCUFpkyJoilxinUg8s9exGYXxs2slVQPll4UdES-4cgJqYxJMR_kbR4Ch4kyQ6itG8R1KYHOr1UZYGnQ=w1064-v0)

A. A card at 1dp elevation with 5% overlay

B. A floating action button at 6dp using a secondary color without an overlay

C. A bottom app bar at 8dp elevation with a 12% overlay

The elevation overlays are not applied to component surfaces that use primary or secondary colors.

In a dark theme, shadows remain dark to accurately represent a cast shadow.

![Component with light color surface.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ff2V4Sq6dsKF4O_N_u7Q1vAVSI4jGxEle_VLx6KskHjLXhHuXF0V4OauyJNpN3JY9oOLk-NZTd4xtNs2w40huR6HAkL3XgHUwyIjCQ=w1064-v0)

Don'tAvoid elevation overlays on components that use a primary or secondary color for their surface container.

### Accessibility and contrast

Accessibility in design allows users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your UI successfully. Related Article arrow\_downward Dark theme surfaces must be dark...

Read more

Dark theme surfaces must be dark enough to display white text. They should use a contrast level of at least 15.8:1 between text and the background. This ensures that body text passes WCAG's AA standard of at least 4.5:1 when applied to surfaces at the highest (and lightest) elevation.

![Diagram with color swatch #1F1B24 and two different color surfaces mixed to create the swatch.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GcjivwLBuHnVnotHyHEPfmQDOmZEgHsviSmGGrg8HirjL6DfKl_jx44ZQcsP-toA-AaPYLMIv8lZR-3PWoJN5VKcI-WN2eZAdVjoUp4=w1064-v0)

To create branded dark surfaces, overlay the primary brand color at a low opacity over the recommended dark theme surface color (#121212). The color #1F1B24 is the result of combining the dark theme surface color #121212 and the 8% Primary color.

If the background color is not dark enough to meet a contrast level of at least 15.8:1 between white text and the surface, text at the highest (and lightest) elevated surface won't pass the 4.5:1 standard.

![Diagram comparing color contrasts of two surface colors.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PFwHTPKUuM9_ZnPFFhTXNthKNArCmQZTwVMoGr0yKheslCyrgyY5a6w5YUtfyOA2KV26ZElcTUSYThxoo5OHFw45F53qnmNuXJ52cg=w1064-v0)

CautionEnsure that the background color is dark enough so that body text meets a contrast level of at least 4.5:1 (AA) on the highest elevated surface (24dp).

UIs that require efficient battery usage can use true black. In these cases, some devices (such as wearables with OLED screens) can turn off any pixels that display black to conserve battery power.

All dark theme colors should display elements with sufficient contrast, passing WCAG's AA standard of at least 4.5:1 for body text when applied to all elevation surfaces.

#### Desaturated colors for accessibility

A dark theme should avoid using saturated colors, as they don't pass WCAG's accessibility standard of at least 4.5:1 for body text against dark surfaces. Saturated colors also produce optical vibrations against a dark background, which can induce eye strain.

Instead, desaturated colors can be used as a more legible alternative.

In a dark theme, dark surfaces occupy the majority of the UI. Accent colors are typically light (desaturated pastels) or bright (saturated, vivid color) to help accented elements stand out. They should be used sparingly to accent key elements, such as text or buttons.

#### Finding accent colors

The [color palette generator](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors "") can be used to create (or view) a color theme. It also generates tonal palettes, which are a range of light to dark color variations, created from your primary and secondary colors. You can select variations of these for your dark theme.

![A tonal palette from 50 to 900, with the 500 tone labeled “1” and the 200 tone labeled “2”](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/373oRj1q6ZEVlP8W7eLz2Q7aSnLRQUn93cLh0YCnj_asRwULEZC2rCJ6OqDLlDtgt_L1lCZgHsSbU5l_R6p_sHSDVTPzjLPZl5RaYto=w1064-v0)

To provide more flexibility and usability in a dark theme, it's recommended to use lighter tones (200-50) in dark theme, rather than your default color theme (saturated tones ranging from 900-500).

## Custom application

Some use cases in Material Design can benefit from using select dark theme elements.

### Large surfaces

Components that use a large portion of a screen, such as an app bar or a backdrop, can use the dark theme for their component's surface color.

![A dark grey app bar with a bright purple FAB](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1ThstbPoPWlNZFftRLU_Gc4hczdEQ0t71jAW-MrYuDsoUS0sJnXpwbVXnIUurhToaTIoRDHNsU7YZ9nyw8r5-eaeBCYOEgHBnl7hQ=w1064-v0)

DoReserve bright colors for smaller surfaces.

CautionIf a dark color is preferred instead of the recommended surface color (hex value #121212), ensure that it passes the 15.8:1 contrast ratio.

![A bright purple backdrop with a dark grey foreground surface](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I1sf7Tah_fr-S5MzTAcNwNCr2QSNRuriZVOXnKnKxfOPMYkW09Wqhe6ml9Yo1fBTkXN7gpUYikt-3_g_wUULHPk-Uh8SVCSfH5BVyw=w1064-v0)

Don'tAvoid using the dark theme primary color for the backdrop because it covers a large portion of the screen with a light color.

### Combining light and dark themes

When a light surface is needed in a dark theme, light coloring can be used on select component surfaces to preserve hierarchy.

For example, a dark theme snackbar can display a light surface to help it stand out. To do so, it can apply the light theme's Surface and On Surface colors.

## States

States visually communicate the status of a component or interactive element through the use of overlays. In a dark theme, states should use the same [overlay](https://material.io/design/interaction/states.html#anatomy "") values as their default (or light) theme, and they can be adjusted to pass AA-level contrast standards.

There are two types of containers that inherit state overlays: containers that use the "Surface" color and the "Primary" color.

### Surface containers

Surface containers that use the color called "Surface" should apply an overlay that matches the color of their icon or text label (if no icon is present).

### Primary containers

For surface containers that use the "Primary" color, their state overlay is white.
