## Why it works

- ### Remove plateaus   by having a clear path



Bunpro gives you clear gradual progression from absolute beginner to grammar master.

- ### Immediately use   what you have learned



Bunpro uses fill in the blank quizzes, greatly improving your ability to apply what you learn, in the real world.

- ### Get dynamic feedback   when quizzed on grammar



Bunpro gives real-time, instant feedback, to help you learn from your mistakes.


## How it works

- ### 1\. Begin studying Grammar & Vocab!



The Bunpro path builds upon itself gradually, by introducing new content and showing you examples that only use things you have already learned.



Don't worry though, if you already know a grammar point, or are using another resource, you have full control over customizing how and what you learn.

- ### 2\. Everything you need to make serious progress.



Progress through your path with interactive grammar breakdowns, example sentences, and resources for each point. Got a question that’s not covered within the resources?



Ask our active community, right from the Grammar Point you’re studying!

- ### 3\. Reinforce with our Spaced Repetition System



Burn what you study into memory! Bunpro has you review each studied Grammar Point at the right time for optimal retention (tailored to you).



This removes the need for worrying about what to review next, allowing you to focus on making progress.
