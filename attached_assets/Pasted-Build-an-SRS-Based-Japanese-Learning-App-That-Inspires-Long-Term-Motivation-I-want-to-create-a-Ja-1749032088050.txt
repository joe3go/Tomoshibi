Build an SRS-Based Japanese Learning App That Inspires Long-Term Motivation

> I want to create a Japanese learning web app (and eventually mobile app) that uses a serious, effective SRS (Spaced Repetition System) at its core — not a gamified or shallow learning tool like Duolingo. The #1 goal is to build consistency and motivation for long-term learners.

This is for learners who want to truly understand and speak Japanese, especially natural, casual, anime-style, or conversational Japanese, not just textbook sentences. They are serious about progress but need help staying consistent through an exciting, emotionally engaging app that rewards commitment and mastery — not just tapping streaks.

I want you to help me conceptualize, design, and describe the entire product, including:

User journey

SRS engine logic

UI/UX design system

Motivational systems

Content structure (grammar, vocab, sentence decks)

Leveling and progression systems

Visual identity

Features that support long-term learning and habit-building

🔁 Core Learning Engine

Build a powerful SRS engine that tracks mastery over time.

Each card can be:

A vocabulary item (word, kanji)

A grammar structure

A full sentence with audio and breakdown


Use intervals based on success/failure (customizable or pre-configured)

Include options for:

Listening-based review

Sentence re-construction

Furigana toggle

Tone/politeness indicators


Track performance across grammar types and speech levels (e.g., polite, casual, masculine/feminine styles)



---

🧭 User Journey (Flow)

1. Onboarding:

Choose a goal: “Understand anime,” “Pass JLPT N5,” “Speak casually,” etc.

Initial placement or start from zero

Set a review habit (time of day, reminder style)

“Preview your journey” — show a future sentence they’ll be able to say



2. Daily Flow:

Quick warm-up / motivational screen

Focused review session with clear SRS logic

Earn visual progression (rank-up, dojo belt, mastery flame, etc.)

Post-review summary showing growth (“You’re 23% fluent in casual N5 conversations”)



3. Progression:

A map or dojo path with unlockable milestones

Cards evolve: plain → colorized → glowing → mastered

Unlock new content as levels progress (e.g., “Polite speech module unlocked”)





---

🧱 Leveling System

Replace XP and fake progress with a dojo belt or tier system

Example structure:

White → Yellow → Orange → Green → Blue → Black

Each belt represents mastery of a set of phrases/grammar points


User earns badges or titles (e.g., "Listener", "Phrase Builder", "Grammar Ronin")

Display a progress bar for each level ("You’ve mastered 8/15 N5 casual structures")



---

✨ Motivation & Habit Building

Daily streaks (optional, encouraging but forgiving)

“Weekly mastery check-ins”: Show what was learned, highlight gains

Soft failure recovery: e.g., “You missed 3 days, welcome back — here’s a light recovery session.”

Streak rescue via reflection (“Why did I miss?” → Custom restart)

Visual storytelling: See your growth as a path, with checkpoints and achievements

"Why this matters" moments: Sentence previews from anime or real usage (e.g., “This line is from My Hero Academia”)



---

💬 Sentence Card System

All learning is sentence-first — vocab and grammar live inside rich examples

Each sentence card includes:

Native audio

Furigana toggle

Translation

Grammar breakdown

Register/usage notes (e.g., “slang / polite / rude / school setting”)

Optional typing input or sentence scramble for deeper recall




---

🎨 Visual & UI/UX Style

Clean, modern, warm — not childish or overly busy

Light zen or anime studio aesthetics

Progression = emotionally satisfying visuals (belts, ranks, glowing cards)

Tap/flip/swipe mechanics, subtle SFX

Focused layout: one action per screen (no clutter or multitasking)

Ideal for solo learners, but community optional



---

🧠 Learning Paths & Content Strategy

Core content should be organized by:

JLPT levels (N5 → N4)

Style: polite, casual, anime, school, Kansai-ben, etc.


Include theme decks (e.g., “Yakuza-style Japanese,” “Ghibli phrases,” “Kindergarten speech”)

Support user-created decks with AI-powered card generation (“Turn this anime line into a review card”)



---

🔧 Bonus Features

Custom reminders (voice from characters, sound effects, quotes)

Reflection log (“Write one sentence in Japanese today”)

“Where I heard this” tagging — link cards to shows, clips, or conversations

“What this means culturally” popups for idioms and slang

Optional AI assistant: Explain grammar, break down cards, chat in simple Japanese
